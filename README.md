# Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-For-Foreground-Extraction
Using  a singular value decomposition (SVD) based dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the foreground in highway traffic footage.

As of now this is very much a work in progress. As of now the DMD has been performed on the highway traffic footage and the background frequency components have been identified. All that remains is DMD signal reconstruction.
